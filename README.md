# Scoreboards
This project was driven by my passion of triathlon. Every event publishes paginated, web-based results but not many allow for a complete file download. Being a slave to data and stats I want to produce my own complete data file that I can cut a slice to my liking.

This project aims to provide that in a pluggable way so results from different sources can be extracted.
